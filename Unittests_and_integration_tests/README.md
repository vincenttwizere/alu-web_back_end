# Unittests and Integration Tests in Python

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to write **Unit Tests** and **Integration Tests** in Python, showcasing best practices for testing individual components as well as testing how different modules and components interact with each other. The goal is to ensure code reliability, maintainability, and overall quality through comprehensive testing.

## What are Unit Tests?

Unit tests are designed to verify the functionality of individual components or units of code (usually functions or methods). The goal of unit tests is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts work correctly.

## What are Integration Tests?

Integration tests verify that different components or modules work together as expected. They ensure that the interactions between units or services function correctly when combined in a larger system.
