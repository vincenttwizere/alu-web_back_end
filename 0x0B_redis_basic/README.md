# 0x0B Redis Basic

## Overview
This project is an introduction to using Redis, a powerful in-memory data structure store commonly used as a database, cache, and message broker. The goal is to learn the basics of working with Redis in a programming environment and explore how it can be used for various use cases such as caching, session management, and real-time analytics.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand the basic concepts of Redis and its use cases.
- Set up a Redis server and connect to it using a programming language (e.g., Python).
- Perform basic operations such as storing, retrieving, and manipulating data in Redis.
- Implement a caching mechanism using Redis.
- Explore advanced Redis features like setting expiration for keys and managing data persistence.

## Technologies Used
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used for database, cache, and message brokering.
- **Programming Language**: Python (or another programming language based on your choice).
- **Redis-py**: A Python client for Redis (if using Python).

## Prerequisites
Before starting this project, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming (or your chosen language).
- An understanding of key-value data stores.
- Redis installed on your local machine or a cloud-based Redis instance.

## Installation

### 1. Install Redis
- **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
