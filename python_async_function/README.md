Python - Async Project

This project explores asynchronous programming in Python, which allows for writing concurrent code that can handle multiple tasks at once without blocking. Asynchronous programming is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as network requests or file operations, where tasks can run concurrently to improve efficiency.

Project Overview

In this project, we cover:

Basic Concepts: Introduction to async/await syntax and the event loop.
Async Functions: Writing asynchronous functions using async def.
Await Expressions: Using await to pause execution until a coroutine completes.
Concurrency: Running multiple tasks concurrently using asyncio.gather and other asyncio features.
Error Handling: Handling exceptions in asynchronous code.
Real-World Examples: Practical examples like async web requests and file operations.
