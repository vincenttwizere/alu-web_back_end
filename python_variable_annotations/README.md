Python - Variable Annotations

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of variable annotations in Python. This feature allows for clearer and more maintainable code by specifying the expected data types of variables. Variable annotations were introduced in PEP 484, providing a way to document code for better readability and debugging.

Project Overview

In this project, we explore:

Basic variable annotations: How to annotate variables with types like int, float, str, etc.
Function annotations: Annotating function parameters and return types.
Complex data types: Using annotations for lists, tuples, dictionaries, and custom types.
Optional types: How to handle variables that might also be None using Optional from the typing module.
Union types: Handling variables that could take multiple types using Union.
Type hinting for callable functions: Annotating functions that take or return other functions.
