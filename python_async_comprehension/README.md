Python - Async Comprehension Project

This project explores asynchronous comprehensions in Python, a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to use comprehensions with asynchronous iterables. Asynchronous comprehensions enable efficient iteration over data that might involve I/O operations, such as web requests or database queries, improving performance in concurrent scenarios.

Project Overview

In this project, we cover:

Introduction to Async Comprehensions: Understanding the basics of async for and async with.
Async List Comprehensions: Using async for to create lists from asynchronous iterables.
Async Generators: Creating and using asynchronous generators with comprehensions.
Error Handling: Managing exceptions in asynchronous comprehensions.
Real-World Examples: Practical examples involving asynchronous data sources like web APIs.
